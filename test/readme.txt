1, 2, and 3 are the same sequence, except that 2 has two segments (50k nt) reordered, and 3 has four segments (25k nt) reordered
4 and 5 are <= 1% divergent
6 and 7 are <= 2% divergent, and 6 has two segments reordered.
8 and 9 are <= 5% divergent
10 is not similar to any other sequence
11 and 12 are the same, but 11 is twice as long as 12.
